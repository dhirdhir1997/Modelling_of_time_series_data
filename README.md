# Modelling_of_time_series_data
The goal of this project is to build an example deep neural network that can predict future outcomes based on **time series**, or sequential, data.  

A time series is a series of data points, ordered in time. For complex systems, each data point will likely be **multivariate**, meaning there are multiple variables for each data point.  Examples of data sets with multivariate time series data are financial markets, air quality measurement, and health records.  In each case, the goal is to predict one of the variable values, such as a stock price, pollutant level, or patient outcome, based on the sequential dependence of past data.  

In this project, we will build a deep neural network model to predict patient mortality from time series data contained in patient records. 


<br><br>
The purpose of building such a model, is to provide an analytic framework that medical professionals can use to predict patient mortality at any time of interest. Such a solution provides essential feedback to clinicians when trying to assess the impact of treatment decisions, or raise early warning signs to flag at-risk patients in a busy hospital care setting.

This project and patient **electronic health record (EHR)** data are provided by Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA).
